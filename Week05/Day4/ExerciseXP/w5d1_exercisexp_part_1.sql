/*	Exercise 1 : Items and customers
Instructions
We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

Use SQL to get the following from the database:
All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) – exclude the primary key column from the results.
All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)--*/

SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY price ASC;

SELECT * FROM items 
WHERE price >= 80 ORDER BY price DESC;

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers ORDER BY first_name ASC LIMIT 3;
